"Figwheel - a tool that helps you compile and reload ClojureScript.

  Refer to the README at https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel

Figwheel commands usage:

  The common way of invoking Figwheel looks like this:

    lein figwheel build-id build-id ...

  The above will run the default Figwheel :reactor command. See below for
  a description.

    lein figwheel [command] build-id build-id ...

  Will execute the given [command] on the build-ids supplied.
  A [command] always starts with a \":\" and should be one of the
  following.

Commands:

:reactor build-id ...

  If no [command] is supplied then this command will be chosen by
  default.

  This command will start a Figwheel autobuild process, server and
  repl based on the supplied configuration. It will start autobuild
  processes for all the build-ids supplied on the command line

  The build-id supplied must exist in your configuration. If no
  build-ids are supplied, Figwheel will pick the first build in your
  config with :optimizations set to nil or :none.

  You can customize witch builds are started by default, by setting
  the :builds-to-start key n your config to a vector of the builds you
  want to start. Example:

    :figwheel {
      :builds-to-start [\"example\"]
    }

  The Figwheel system will watch your ClojureScript files for
  changes. When your files change Figwheel will compile them and
  attempt to notify a Figwheel client that these changes have occurred

:check-config

  This will run a validation check on your configuration.

  All arguments supplied to this command will be ignored.

:once build-id ..

  This will build all the supplied builds once. No autobuilder or
  watching process will be launched. If no build-ids are supplied this
  command will build all the builds in your config.

  The Figwheel ClojureScript will not be injected into any of these
  builds.

:help

  Prints this documentation

Configuration:

  Figwheel relies on a configuration that is found in the project.clj
  or in a figwheel.edn file in your project root. If a figwheel.edn is
  present any Figwheel configuration found in the project.clj will be
  ignored.

  To learn more about configuring Figwheel please see the README at
  https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel
